# Install

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

**Running on Google Cloud Platform**

1. clone `google-cloud` branch on your computer
2. install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/), [docker](https://www.docker.com/), [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
3. sign up free account with $100 on google cloud and sign up docker hub account
4. create an image by running `docker build -t <YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME>/<YOUR_IMAGE_NAME> .` in every folder that has Dockerfile
5. push al images to docker hub by running `docker push <YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME>/<YOUR_IMAGE_NAME>` in every folder that you already created image
6. create a new project then enable `Kubernetes Engine API` and `Cloud Build API` then enable `Cloud Build` service account permission
7. create a new kubernetes cluster with minimum resource, 3 nodes, and select any region that closest to you
8. install `GCP SDK` to connect our images to GCP cluster context
9. open google cloud SDK and log in by running `gcloud auth login` then initiate with `gcloud init` command, choose the correct options to proceed
10. create kubernetes context in your desktop by running `gcloud container clusters get-credentials <YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME>` (your cluster name from GCP cluster that you created)
11. see list of contexts by running `kubectl config get-contexts`, select new context by running `kubectl config use-context <CONTEXT_NAME>`
12. install [ingress-nginx](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/#quick-start) and [ingress-nginx for GCP](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/#gce-gke)
13. find your load balancing port that GCP automatic generated in `Network Services` tab in GCP
14. for `windows` users, open host file `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` to edit by adding `YOUR_LOAD_BALANCING_PORT YOUR_EXAMPLE_URL` and save as an admin (ex. `56.125.456.45 example.com`)
15. config all yaml files to matches your example URL
16. create all [kubernetes secrets](#setup-env)
17. run `skaffold dev` in this project root directory, make sure to use correct context before run command
18. check all pods in a cluster by running `kubectl get pods`
19. open a web browser enter your example URL to see this project come to live!

**Running on Docker Desktop**

1. work in process...

# Setup ENV

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

**MONGO_URI_USER, MONGO_URI_PRODUCT, MONGO_URI_ORDER, MONGO_URI_PAYMENT** : [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

**JWT_KEY** : --whatever you want--

**STRIPE_KEY** : [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)

**PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID** : [Paypal](https://developer.paypal.com/home)

Create all these secrets in kubernetes secret by run this command line

`kubectl create secret generic jwt-secret --from-literal=JWT_KEY=<YOUR SECRET>`

# Deploy

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

**Deploy on DigitalOcean**

1. sign up free account with $100 and 60 days trial
2. create a Kubernetes cluster in new project
3. generate new token, install [doctl](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/doctl/how-to/install/) and [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
4. connect with digitalOcean k8s cluster context by running `doctl kubernetes cluster kubeconfig save <YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME>` and authorize with your credentials
5. switch kubernetes context to the new context by running `kubectl config use-context <CONTEXT_NAME>`
6. create `github workflow` for initial build an docker image on push event on `main` branch and perform automation testing by running `jest` script in every services on pull request event trigger with trying to merge with `main` branch
7. add github action secret for docker credentials
8. purchase a domain name with a promotion that can be very cheap as $1 for 1st year
9. Separate k8s folder to k8s-dev and k8s-prod then copy `ingress-srv.yaml` file to both folders and edit host URL to a new domain name
10. create `github workflow` for telling kubernetes cluster to use images we built by adding this

```
- uses: digitalocean/action-doctl@v2
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
- run: doctl kubernetes cluster kubeconfig save <YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME>
- run: kubectl rollout restart deployment <YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_NAME>
```

11. add github action secret for digitalocean token key
12. config domain name nameserver with your domain name registor website by custom add `ns1.digitalocean.com`, `ns2.digitalocean.com`. `ns3.digitalocean.com`
13. add domain name in digital ocean at networking tab then create new record

```
// A record
HOSTNAME: @
WILL DIRECT TO: select your-load-balancer
TTL: 30

// CNAME record
HOSTNAME: www
IN AN ALIAS OF: @
TTL: 30
```

14. waiting for 5-10 minutes for websie to setup
15. browsing to your website with `HTTP` protocal
16. if you want to browse with `HTTPS` this link is for you to follow [How to Set Up an Nginx Ingress with Cert-Manager on DigitalOcean Kubernetes](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-an-nginx-ingress-with-cert-manager-on-digitalocean-kubernetes)
